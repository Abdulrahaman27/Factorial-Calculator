# Factorial App

## Overview  
The **Factorial App** is a simple web application that calculates the factorial of a given number. It takes user input, computes the factorial, and displays the result in real time.

## Features  
- Easy-to-use interface  
- Handles both small and large numbers  
- Validates user input to prevent errors  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Structure of the application  
- **CSS**: Styling the user interface  
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for factorial computation  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/factorial-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd factorial-app
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the app.  

## How It Works  
1. The user enters a number in the input field.  
2. The app calculates the factorial of the number using JavaScript.  
3. The result is displayed dynamically below the input field.  

## Use Cases  
Here are some real-world applications of the **Factorial App**:  
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Quickly calculate factorials for academic or competitive math problems.  
- **Probability and Combinatorics**: Use factorials to compute permutations, combinations, and probabilities.  
- **Programming Practice**: Serve as an example for learning basic JavaScript functionality and input handling.  
- **Educational Tool**: Help students understand the concept of factorials with instant results.  

## Example  
Input: `5`  
Output: `120`  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for negative numbers and error handling.  
- Implement a "dark mode" for better user experience.  
- Create an API to serve factorial computations.
